I'm a postdoc with the USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, working on developing strategies for management of migratory birds under climate change. Climate change is leading to uncertain but inevitable changes in range, phenology, community composition, and population dynamics of migratory birds. How does our decision process change when observations of the past are no longer reliable predictors of the future?   
  
I'm broadly interested in understanding full annual cycle population dynamics (with a special interest in migratory species) using quantitative tools that help us predict population responses to changing environmental conditions. My research combines full life cycle ecology, quantitative methods, and applications to management and conservation issues.  
  
I previosly worked with [Conor McGowan](http://www.auburn.edu/~cpm0014/) in the USGS Alabama Fish and Wildlife Cooperative Research Unit to develop analysis and projection modeling tools to support Species Status Assessments for the USFWS--these assessments provide the scientific support for classification and recovery decisions under the Endangered Species Act.  
  
My dissertation work focused on stopover ecology and population dynamics of migratory shorebirds. I used a long-term mark-recapture dataset from Delaware Bay to understand how shorebirds respond to changing stopover conditions, and how stopover conditions can influence population dynamics and stability. 

I completed my Masters degree with [Lesley Bulluck](https://rampages.us/bullucklab/) at VCU, working on questions about the breeding ecology of a box-nesting population of prothonotary warblers. See my Research page for more info about past, present, and future projects!
