I'm a postdoc at Auburn University working with [Conor McGowan](http://www.auburn.edu/~cpm0014/) in the USGS Alabama Fish and Wildlife Cooperative Research Unit. We're working with USFWS partners to develop analysis and projection modeling tools to support Species Status Assessments--these assessments provide the scientific support for classification and recovery decisions under the Endangered Species Act.  
  
I recently completed my PhD investigating stopover ecology and population dynamics of migratory shorebirds. I used a long-term mark-recapture dataset from Delaware Bay to understand how shorebirds respond to changing stopover conditions, and how stopover conditions can influence population dynamics and stability. 

I'm broadly interested in understanding full annual cycle population dynamics(with a special interest in migratory species) using quantitative tools that help us predict population responses to changing environmental conditions. My research combines full life cycle ecology, quantitative methods, and applications to management and conservation issues.  

I completed my Masters degree with [Lesley Bulluck](https://rampages.us/bullucklab/) at VCU, working on questions about the breeding ecology of a box-nesting population of prothonotary warblers. See my Research page for more info about past, present, and future projects!
